# RezoningScraper

A small project written for [Abundant Housing Vancouver](http://www.abundanthousingvancouver.com).

Scrapes the City of Vancouver's website for rezoning and development applications, then notifies people of any changes via Slack. It's a simple standalone app using SQLite as a data store, runs on any major OS. Just copy the app (1 file, no dependencies) to a server and run it with a cron job, no further steps needed.
